         <p><span class="first-para"></span>From star restaurant to cozy
            cafes, he has experienced it all at
            the young age of 18 years. It is
            this experience that makes him a
            force to be reckoned with in the
            business</p>
         <p class="">He knows that the initial 6
            months of a restaurant’s lifespan
            are crucial for establishing a
            name in the industry. He handles
            this time delicately along with
            investor, once the business is
            stable and the marketing is on
            fire, he hands over the restaurant
            to the investors.</p>

         <p class="">With Magi-a Mr. Kuvam has
            placed a new benchmark in the
            F&B consultancy business.</p>

         <p>Despite his experience he
            believes a man never stops
            learning, as a strives everyday to
            take Magi-a a step further.<span class="last-para"></span></p>

      <div class="para-section text-left pop-light mt-5" data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-once="true"
         data-aos-duration="1300">

         <p>Our director,<span> Mr. Kuvam Gujral</span> established Magi-a in 2018 when he saw that many new restaurant/
            Cafe owners
            were struggling to run, or get services in terms of restaurant operations & stability in P&L. People get
            into the restaurant business expecting loads of profits with dreams of franchising out, but fail for the
            mere reasons of poor support in terms of staffing & services provided by the consultation firm they are
            linked with.

         </p>

         <p>
            He noticed how most consultation firms would provide services to 3 to 6 months Initially and then the
            business tends to drop down, following which the business would suffer huge losses. If the do agree to
            provide support, they charge a retainer fee, which would be high and not affordable by a business owner
            already swimming in loss because of their previous experiences.
         </p>

         <p>
            He started Magi-a with the goal of creating magic for these Restaurant & Cafe owners and solve all their
            problems in the blink of an eye. By proving the best services to our existing clients and as well as new
            clients, we make sure you never have to worry about business failure.
         </p>

         <p>
            He grew up in the business, and has experienced the nuances of it first hand. <br> <span>Mr Kuvam </span>
            does
            not look at a
            business through the eyes of an investor. Our old Indian values of, <b>‘Athithi Devo Bhav’</b> are instilled
            in
            him. He looks at a restaurant through the eyes of its guests, which is the reason why his consultancy is on
            spot.
            His experience in the field comes from him being a restaurant owner himself of a renowned chain. His chain
            of fine-dining restaurants, Pan-Asia & abroad, serving Modern Indian, Chinese, Continental, Italian,
            Barbeque Grill Restaurants South Indian & Fusion Food are viewed as some of the best restaurants in the
            market. Before getting into the family business, he completed his education from Pathway World School.
         </p>

         <p>
            He decided it was time to further expand his legacy of over 10 years and established Magi-a as his own
            company. With hands on experience working in the parental company, he knows the what and what nots of the
            business.
         </p>

         <p>To <span>Mr. Kuvam</span>, Magi-a is the future of the F&B consultancy, and for that purpose he trains most
            of his Franchisees himself. Teaching them how to operate a restaurant business, while following certain SOP
            and also controlling the pilferages.

         </p>

         <p>
            We are so confident in Magi-a that <span> Mr. Kuvam</span> states, “If you feel that our services have
            lacked in terms of operations and management, then you can claim your fees back.” As for him the main aim is
            client satisfaction.
            <span> Mr. Kuvam</span> states the worlds most expensive thing is “TRUST” Which is very important for his
            clients to have
            on him cause he is trying to create a brand and soon a legacy for them.
         </p>

         <p>
            <span> Mr. Kuvam</span> is always very invested in his client’s business, as of it were his own. He finds it
            a privilege to be able to help his clients right from the scratch to the end of their projects, including,
            the designing, selection of site, a unique name for the retardant that will reflect its values. He even
            takes care of negotiating with landlords and trains the investors so they are well prepared to operate their
            outlets.
         </p>
         <p>
            From star restaurant to cozy cafes, he has experienced it all at the young age of 12 years. It is this
            experience that makes him a force to be reckoned with in the business.
         </p>
         <p>
            He knows that the initial 6 months of a restaurant’s lifespan are crucial for establishing a name in the
            industry. He handles this time delicately along with investor and his team.
         </p>
         <p>
            With Magi-a <span>Mr. Kuvam</span> has placed a new benchmark in the F&B consultancy business.
